### **Architecture Flow:**

```
User Creates Object (Asteroid Panel)
         ↓
handleAddCustomObject() in page.tsx
         ↓
Added to customObjects state
         ↓
Passed to <SolarSystem customObjects={customObjects} />
         ↓
SolarSystem component renders in 3D
         ↓
✨ 3D MESH + ORBIT PATH + ANIMATION ✨
```

## 🔍 Console Logs

When you add an object, check **browser console** (F12):

```
✅ Created enhanced mesh for Test Asteroid 1 (ID: ast_1234...)
✅ Created orbit path for Test Asteroid 1
✨ Added particle tail for comet Test Comet
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "I don't see the object!"**

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Is the orbit visible? (Check if orbit ellipse appears)
2. ✅ Is object too small? (Increase "Visual Size" slider)
3. ✅ Is object too far? (Zoom out with scroll wheel)
4. ✅ Is object behind Sun? (Wait a few seconds for orbit)
5. ✅ Check console for errors (F12)

---

### **Problem: "Orbit appears but no object"**

**Possible causes:**
1. Object size too small (minimum 0.5 scene units)
2. Object position at perihelion (far end of orbit)
3. WebGL rendering issue (refresh page)

**Solution:**
- Increase "Visual Size" to 2-3x
- Increase "Radius" to 10+ km
- Wait 10-20 seconds for orbital motion

---

### **Problem: "Object appears but doesn't move"**

**Check:**
1. Is simulation paused? (Click play button)
2. Is time speed = 0? (Adjust time controls)
3. Browser tab inactive? (Click on tab)

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### **Correct 3D Animation Flow:**

```
Object Added
    ↓
Mesh Created (0.1s)
    ↓
Orbit Path Rendered (0.1s)
    ↓
Position Calculated (every frame)
    ↓
Mesh Updated (60 FPS)
    ↓
Rotation Applied (every frame)
    ↓
Special Effects (comet tail, etc.)
```

### **Frame-by-Frame:**

- **Frame 1**: Object appears at calculated position
- **Frame 2**: Position updated based on orbital mechanics
- **Frame 3**: Rotation incremented
- **Frame 4**: Comet tail oriented away from sun
- **Frame 5+**: Continuous smooth motion

## 🧮 Technical Details

### **Orbital Mechanics Used:**

```typescript
// Kepler's equation for position:
r = a(1 - e²) / (1 + e·cos(θ))

// 3D orientation transformations:
1. Rotate by argument of perihelion (ω)
2. Apply inclination (i) - tilt orbit plane
3. Rotate by longitude of ascending node (Ω)

// Convert AU to scene units:
sceneUnits = AU × 28  // Earth is at 28 units
```

### **Rotation Formulas:**

```typescript
// Asteroid (tumbling):
rotation.x = time × 0.02 + sin(time × 0.01) × 0.1
rotation.y = time × 0.015
rotation.z = time × 0.008

// Comet (slow):
rotation.x = time × 0.005
rotation.y = time × 0.008
```

## ✨ Cool Visual Effects

### **Comet Tail System:**

- **500 particles** trailing behind
- **Additive blending** (glowing effect)
- **Dynamic orientation** (points away from sun)
- **Distance-based brightness**:
  - Close to sun = bright, long tail
  - Far from sun = dim, short tail
- **Color gradient**: Cyan → Transparent

### **Asteroid Deformation:**

```typescript
// Random vertex displacement:
randomScale = 0.7 + Math.random() × 0.6
// Result: 70% to 130% of original size
// Creates unique irregular shape
```
